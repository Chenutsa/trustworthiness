experiment_E1.R: 
The program for Numerical Experiment in Section III.E. 1). It is used to generate data, calculate naive and adjusted estimators, and output the estimates to data file for further processing.

experiment_VB.R:
The program for simulations in Section V.B. It is used to generate the same data as in experiment_E1.R and output the estimates from applying the Bayesian method in the paper Kantchelian et al. (2015). It is better to output the data to the same directory as data outputs from experiment_E1.R.  

experiment_E1_VBa.R:
The program for futher analysis of the output data from experiment_E1.R and experiment_VB.R.

fpfn_readldat.csv:
Excel file containing the estimated false positive and false negative probabilites from a run on the application data. This is used to as the inputs to set the true parameters in the simulations of Section III.E. 2).

experiment_E2.R: 
The program for Numerical Experiment in Section III.E. 2). It is used to generate data, calculate naive and adjusted estimators, and output the estimates to data file for further processing. 

experiment_E2a.R:
The program for futher analysis of the output data from experiment_E2.R.

experiment_VC.R:
The program for Numerical Experiment in Section V.C. It is used to generate data, calculate adjusted estimators, and output the estimates to data file for further processing. 

experiment_VCa.R:
The program for further processing the data output from experiment_VC.R.
